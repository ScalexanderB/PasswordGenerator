## What I did for this assignment:

* Created pseudo-code in commented form at the top of the JS file to be a guide for the assignment
* Wrote the code for the functions corresponding to the generate password button on the HTML file
* Made sure the first prompt was to ask the user how long the password will be
* Followed with 4 confirm windows to establish the desired parameters of the password complexity
* Once the user has confirmed the parameters of the password it will generate the password on the screen
